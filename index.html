      <em>Telemedicine</em> is the use of digital information and communication technologies, such as computers and mobile devices, to access health care
      services remotely and manage health care.Telemedicine is being used to improve clinical care and reduce cost of health care for patients.
    </p>
    <h2>Components of Telemedicine</h2>
    <p>
      Virtual Consultations: Patients can connect with healthcare providers through video calls, phone calls, or messaging platforms. This allows for consultations on various health issues without needing to travel.
      <br />
      Remote Monitoring: Patients can use wearable devices and mobile apps to track their health metrics (e.g., heart rate, blood glucose levels), which can be shared with their healthcare providers for ongoing management.
      <br />
      Access to Specialists: Telemedicine provides patients in remote or underserved areas access to specialists who might not be locally available.
      <br />
      Increased Convenience: Patients can receive care from the comfort of their homes, reducing travel time and associated costs.
      <br />
      Cost-Effectiveness: Telemedicine can reduce healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary in-person visits and hospitalizations.
      <br />
      Improved Patient Engagement: It encourages patients to take an active role in their healthcare, often leading to better health outcomes.
